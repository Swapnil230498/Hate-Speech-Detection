Project Name: Hate Speech Detection

About

Welcome to the Hate Speech Detection project! This repository aims to combat the spread of hate speech on social media platforms by developing a powerful and accurate hate speech detection system. The project utilizes the Twitter Speech dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains a diverse collection of tweets that have been labeled for hate speech, offensive language, or classified as non-hate and non-offensive.

Dataset

The project employs the Twitter Speech dataset, sourced from Kaggle, to build and train the hate speech detection model. This dataset contains a substantial number of tweets, each labeled as either hate speech, offensive language, or no hate nor offensive language, making it an excellent foundation for developing an effective classification system.

Details

In this project, we follow a comprehensive approach to preprocess the textual data before building the hate speech detection model. The preprocessing phase involves several key steps to ensure the data is clean and well-structured.

    Feature Extraction: An essential step in the preprocessing phase involves removing irrelevant columns from the dataset. By carefully selecting relevant features, we improve the model's efficiency and avoid unnecessary noise in the data.

    Text Preprocessing: Using the powerful regular expression module, we remove special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary symbols from the tweets. Additionally, stopwords are eliminated to reduce noise in the dataset, thereby improving the model's performance.

    Lemmatization/Stemming: We utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform lemmatization or stemming on the text data. This step helps to reduce words to their base form, which simplifies the data representation and enhances the model's ability to generalize effectively.

    Vectorization: To enable the machine learning models to process textual data, we employ the CountVectorizer from the renowned scikit-learn library. This powerful technique converts the processed text data into a vectorized format, making it suitable for training the models.

    Model Implementation: The hate speech detection model is trained using the scikit-learn library. We split the dataset into an 80-20 ratio, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing. The 'tweets' column in the dataset is considered the independent variable, while the 'label' serves as the target variable with labels "hate speech," "offensive language," and "no hate nor offensive."

    Two Models Compared: We have implemented two different models for hate speech detection:

    a) Multinomial Naive Bayes: This probabilistic classifier is particularly useful for text classification tasks and has proven to be effective in various natural language processing applications.

    b) Decision Tree: Decision trees provide a clear and interpretable way to classify data based on a sequence of decision rules, making them suitable for understanding how the model arrives at its predictions.

    Classification Report: After training the models, we generate a comprehensive classification report. This report presents key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, providing valuable insights into the models' performance for each class label.

Conclusion

The Hate Speech Detection project is an essential step towards creating a safer and more inclusive social media environment. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing, our models aim to identify and mitigate the spread of hate speech and offensive language effectively. We encourage you to explore this repository, gain insights from the code, and contribute to the ongoing efforts in curbing hate speech on social media.

We sincerely hope that this project will inspire others to address important societal issues through the application of innovative technologies. Thank you for your interest and support in this endeavor.
